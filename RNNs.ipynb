        "\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data by retaining a \"memory\" of previous inputs in the sequence. This makes them particularly useful for tasks where context or order matters, such as time-series forecasting, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Characteristics\n",
        "- **Sequence Handling**: RNNs can process sequences of variable length.\n",
        "- **Memory Mechanism**: They maintain a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "## RNN Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "An RNN is characterized by a loop within its architecture, allowing information to be passed from one step of the sequence to the next.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Components\n",
        "- **Input Layer**: Receives the sequence data.\n",
        "- **Hidden Layer**: Maintains the hidden state that is updated at each time step.\n",
        "- **Output Layer**: Produces the output for each time step or for the entire sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mathematical Representation\n",
        "For a given time step `t`:\n",
        "- **Hidden state update**:\n",
        "  \\[\n",
        "  h_t = \\sigma(W_{hh}h_{t-1} + W_{xh}x_t + b_h)\n",
        "  \\]\n",

        "- \\( y_t \\) is the output at time step `t`.\n",
        "- \\( W_{hh} \\), \\( W_{xh} \\), and \\( W_{hy} \\) are the weight matrices.\n",
        "- \\( b_h \\) and \\( b_y \\) are the biases.\n",
        "- \\( \\sigma \\) is the activation function, typically `tanh` or `ReLU`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)\n",
        "RNNs are trained using a variant of backpropagation called Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), which considers the dependencies between time steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Types of RNNs\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Vanilla RNN**\n",
        "   - The simplest form of RNN with a single hidden layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**\n",
        "   - Designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla RNNs.\n",
        "   - Introduces gates (input, forget, and output gates) to control the flow of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**\n",
        "   - A variant of LSTM with fewer gates, making it computationally more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Bidirectional RNN**\n",
        "   - Processes the sequence in both forward and backward directions, capturing information from both past and future states.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Deep RNNs**\n",
        "   - Consist of multiple RNN layers stacked on top of each other, allowing the network to capture more complex patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications of RNNs\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**\n",
        "   - Language Modeling\n",
        "   - Machine Translation\n",

        "   - Stock Price Prediction\n",
        "   - Weather Forecasting\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Speech Recognition**\n",
        "   - Voice Assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)\n",
        "   - Automated Transcription\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Image Captioning**\n",
        "   - Generating descriptions for images by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and RNNs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenges of RNNs\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Vanishing and Exploding Gradients**\n",
        "   - Gradients can become too small or too large during training, leading to difficulty in learning long-term dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Long Training Times**\n",
        "   - RNNs can be slow to train due to the sequential nature of processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Difficulty in Parallelization**\n",
        "   - Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs process data sequentially, making them harder to parallelize.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Short-Term Memory**\n",
        "   - Vanilla RNNs struggle to retain information from the distant past, which is partially addressed by LSTMs and GRUs.\n",
